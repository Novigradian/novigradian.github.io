  aboutMe:
    "I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California with a passion for game development and software engineering. I have 4+ years of experience with Unity and have published various projects both with a team and independently. I'm currently an engineer for Overdawn, a bullet-hell shooter releasing later this year (wishlist on Steam!) <br> Besides game dev, I'm also part of Taking the Sidequests, an urban exploration channel. In my spare time I enjoy cooking and creative writing. Thanks for stopping by! :)",
